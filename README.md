### Root Directory

- `Dataset/`: This directory contains the MNIST dataset files.
- `Documents/`: This directory holds documentation, reports, and any additional project-related documents.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the Python dependencies needed for the project.
- `README.md`: The main readme file providing an overview and setup instructions for the project.

### Source Directory

- `checkpoints/`: Directory to save and load model checkpoints during training.
- `configs/`: Contains configuration files for model parameters, training settings, etc.
- `dataloader/`: Includes scripts for loading the MNIST dataset.
- `dataset/`: Scripts related to dataset handling and manipulation, and also the preprocessed dataset.
- `loss/`: Contains loss functions.
- `model/`: Directory for defining the neural network architecture and model classes.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and visualization.
- `optimizer/`: Optimizer functions.
- `test/`: Scripts for testing and evaluating the model.
- `train/`: Training scripts.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helper scripts.
- `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `Source` module.
- `main.py`: The main script to run the project.


## Setup Instructions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PooryaAghaomidi/Tensorflow-template.git
   ```
   
2. Create an environment and set interpreter to `Python v3.10`

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```shell
   pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Usage

1. Dataset Preparation: Ensure the MNIST dataset is downloaded from `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv` and placed in the `Dataset/` directory.

The structure must be similar to [Project Structure](#project-structure).

2. Open `main.py` and run this file.
